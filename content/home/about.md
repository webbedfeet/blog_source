# Biography

Abhijit Dasgupta is an expert statistician and data scientist in the Washington DC metropolitan area. His
primary interests lie in developing innovative modeling and visualization techniques to help understand
the data-generative process. Dr. Dasgupta has broad expertise in statistics and machine learning methods, data analytics, data visualization and signal processing. He is an expert in using R and Python for 
data science. 

Dr. Dasgupta has applied his skills in a wide variety of domains. The majority of his work has been
in biomedical research, but he has also contributed to the development of wearable health technologies
through [Zansors](http://www.zansors.com), a Virgnia-based health technology startup. He has also consulted and collaborated
in business analytics, signal processing, operations research and clinical trials. Over the years
Dr Dasgupta has collaborated on and successfully won several competitive grants from the NIH, including 6 SBIR/STTR grants. He also serves as a reviewer for both the National Institute of Mental Health's Data
Safety Monitoring Boards and the Center for Scientific Review of the NIH. 

One of Dr. Dasgupta's passions is in passing on knowledge to the next generation of data scientists. 
He has co-organized the successful Statistical Programming DC meetup since 2010, which was the first
data science meetup in the Washington DC area and spawned several other meetups and the well-known 
Data Community DC organization, that today boasts over 15000 members. He served on the Board of 
Data Community DC for several years. Dr. Dasgupta has also conducted well-regarded workshops, continuing
education courses and corporate trainings on data science topics, including R and Python, machine learning
and best data analytic practices, often in partnership with [District Data Labs](https://www.districtdatalabs.com/). He teaches in and is co-chair of the Bioinformatics and Data Science 
Department of the [FAES Graduate School at NIH](https://faes.org/content/graduate-school). 

Dr. Dasgupta is open to opportunities in data science consulting, training, teaching and grant collaborations.
