Last month I [published](https://statbandit.wordpress.com/2016/01/15/crowdsourcing-research/) some thoughts on crowdsourcing research, inspired by Anthony Goldbloom's talk at [Statistical Programming DC](http://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc) on the [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com) experience. Today, I found a rather similar [discussion](https://www.good.is/infographics/ridding-scientific-studies-of-bias)  on crowdsourcing research (on the online version of the magazine [Good](http://www.good.is)) as a potential way to increase the accuracy of scientific research and reducing bias. I think more consideration needs to be made both by academia, funding agencies, journals and consumers of scientific and technological research to break silos and make progress accurate and reproducible, and finding new ways of preserving the profit imperative in technological progress that allows for the sharing and crowdsourcing of knowledge and research progress.
