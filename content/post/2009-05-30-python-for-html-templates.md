One of the products I produce for my microarray clients is web sites which graphically and tabularly summarize the results, including annotation of the transcripts using online databases which are linked to the page. It is not unusual, after pathway analysis, to have 100s of pages. Wonder if there is a python templating framework that can make shorter order of this than I'm doing now.
