Recently, while preparing to teach a workshop, I came across some old government data stored in Excel that I wanted to use as an example of cleaning complex tables using R. This data was the average daily attendance as a percentage of total enrollment, school day length, and school year length in public schools, by school level and state during the school year 2007-2008[^1]. Typical of many government tables, this table has multiple headers, extraneous text and merged data fields. In other words, it was anything but tidy; see below:

There are several obvious issues with this table:

1. Table title in first row
1. Multiple headers formed by merged cells
1. Extraneous row 4
1. Extraneous dots in state names
1. Means and standard errors laid out contiguously with no headers
1. Presence of footnotes

As I have shown [before](../tidying-messy-excel-data-tidyxl/), this kind of table cannot be read in to R using `read_excel` or other standard methods. The tools of choice here are the [`tidyxl`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyxl) and [`unpivotr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=unpivotr) packages by [Duncan Garmonsway](https://github.com/nacnudus).
