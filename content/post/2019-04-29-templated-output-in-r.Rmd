[Earo Wang](https://twitter.com/earowang), who is the curator for the [We are R-Ladies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) twitter feed this week (last week of April, 2019), had a [really nice tweet](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies/status/1122816061164797953) about using the [_whisker_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/whisker/index.html) package to create a template incorporating text and data in R. Her example created a list of [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org) packages with descriptions. 

I really liked the example, but thought that the [glue](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glue/index.html) package might be able to do the same thing. I used Earo's code to generate a tibble with the package names and descriptions, and `glue_data` to create the templated list. 

```{r, results = 'asis', message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
tidy_pkgs <- 
  tibble('pkgs' = c('ggplot2','purrr','readr','tidyr',
                    'dplyr','forcats','lubridate','stringr')) %>% 
  mutate(descr = map_chr(pkgs, ~packageDescription(., fields='Description')))

glue_data(tidy_pkgs, 
          "- [**{pkgs}**](http://{pkgs}.tidyverse.org): {descr}")
```
