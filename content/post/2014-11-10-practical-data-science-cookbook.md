My friends [Sean Murphy](http://www.twitter.com/sayhitosean), [Ben Bengfort](http://www.twitter.com/bbengfort), [Tony Ojeda](http://www.twitter.com/tonyojeda3) and I recently published a book, **Practical Data Science Cookbook**. All of us are heavily involved in developing the data community in the Washington DC metro area, serving on the Board of Directors of [Data Community DC](http://www.datacommunitydc.org). Sean and Ben co-organize the meetup [**Data Innovation DC**](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Business-DC/) and I co-organize the meetup [**Statistical Programming DC**](http://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/).

Our intention in writing this book is to provide the data practitioner some guidance about how to navigate the data science pipeline, from data acquisition to final reports and data applications. We chose the languages [R](//www.r-project.org) and [Python](http://www.python.org) to demonstrate our recipes since they are by far the most popular open-source languages for data science, with large ecosystems of mature data-related packages and active contributors. We selected several domains to demonstrate what we feel are interesting use cases that will have broad interest.

You can buy the book either in print form or as a DRM-free e-book from [Packt](http://bit.ly/1pI0vz3), the publisher, or [O'Reilly](http://oreil.ly/1oBOiLh.). Print and e-book versions are also available from [Amazon](http://amzn.to/11aNaUS), [Barnes & Noble](http://bit.ly/1oBOcDw). We hope you will find this book useful for your data science work and understanding.
