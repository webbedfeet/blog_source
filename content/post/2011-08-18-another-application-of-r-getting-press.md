Prof. Atul Butte of Stanford University and colleagues just published two articles in _Science Translational Research_ which got a fair amount of press.  In fact I heard about the work on the radio on my commute to work. The research involves developing a computational method which can look at drug-disease interactions based on the NCBI GEO repository to discover potentially new uses for approved drugs. On reading the paper, I realized that their main computational tool is R, in particular the Bioconductor tools as well as _pvclust_  and _qvalue_. You can read the article [here](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/3/96/96ra77.full).
